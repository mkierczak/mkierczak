![Marcin Kierczak](assets/marcin1.png){width="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;"} I am a *bioinformatics data scientist* {{< fa hat-wizard >}}, currently working at the [National Bioinformatics Infrastructure](https://nbis.se), Sweden at the Health & Clinical Support Team. I am also an associate professor in bioinformatics {{< fa graduation-cap >}}  at the Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University and at the Science For Life Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden.

As a data scientist at NBIS, I am supporting research projects across Sweden with focus on: 
{{< fa robot >}} machine-learning and AI (neural nets), {{< fa chart-column >}} statistical genomics, {{< fa bone >}} aDNA (ancient/historical DNA), {{< fa bacteria >}} metagenomics and {{< fa barcode >}} DNA metabarcoding, {{< fa computer >}} programming languages: {{< fa brands r-project >}} and {{< fa brands python >}}.

Since 2018, together with my colleagues, I am organizing [RaukR. Advanced R Programming for Bioinformatics](https://nbisweden.github.io/raukr-2024/) Summer School in Visby, Sweden.

My **other interests** include: {{< fa microchip >}} microcontroller programming and electronics, {{< fa cubes >}} additive manufacturing (3d printing), {{< fa radio >}} software-defined radio and digital modes, {{< fa music >}} jazz, jazz/classical fusion, {{< fa person-hiking >}} hiking, {{< fa ship >}} boating/sailing, {{< fa map >}} GPS, astro- and terrestrial navigation.
